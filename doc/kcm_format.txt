CODE
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
READING THE MAP HEADER
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  byte id[4] = { 'K', 'M', 'A', 'P' }

This identifies the file as an authentic KCM file.

  byte compatability = 0x80
  byte map_version

If compatability is less than 0x80, then the compatability and map_version
bytes don't actually exist and the file read position should be changed back
to 4. Bits 0-6 are reserved in the compatability byte and should remain 0. The
map_version byte is used to help keep compatability with outdated versions of
the KCM file format. At this time, this byte should be 0.

  byte map_size_x
  byte map_size_y

Map size is measured in screens (that's 20 blocks per single X screen, and 14
blocks per single Y screen.) The upper 2 bits of map_size_y are used to add
additional rows to the Y size. These are added in sets of 2, so you can extend
the Y size by 2, 4, or 6 rows.

  word map_theme

The map_theme defines the theme to be used by the map. The lower nybble of
each byte is used to do this. Both nybbles should match. Theme 0 is unused,
but 0x1 through 0xA can be used. These themes are labeled as follows: sky,
ice, hill, isle, desert, swamp, mtn, under, forest, and urban. The map_flags
is used to define any special "features" in the map.

The other nybbles are used as flags to put special "features" in the map. The
nybble of the first byte (big-endian order) makes the map a chase scene if the
nybble is 8. The other nybble can have the following effects for values from 1
to 3: storm with hail, storm without hail, and lava shooting up.

  word player_x
  word player_y
  word flag_x
  word flag_y

These words are used to define the X and Y positions of the player and the
end-of-level flag. Maps with no flag have the flag moved outside the map area.

  word ptr_tiles_front
  word ptr_blocks
  word ptr_tiles_back
  word ptr_enemies
  word ptr_platforms
  word ptr_lava

These are pointers to various data types in the KCM file. The value of the
ptr_tiles_front will determine how many of these pointers (and subsequently,
how many data types) exist in the KCM file. If ptr_tiles_front points to the
location after it, then pointers from ptr_blocks through ptr_lava don't exist.
Pointers are absolute (e.g. based on offset 0 in the KCM file) and should be
read as little-endian. The size of each data type is based on the value of the
pointer for the next data type. Wherever the data begins for a data type is
where the previous data type is cut off. The last data type runs to the end of
the file.


Now the tile layout is a simple uncompressed, byte-for-byte store. The block layout however is condensed. For block layout, a byte of 0x80 of higher is a block. When a block is defined, there's four bytes that follow that contain the parameters for that block. If the byte is less than 0x80, that tells how many empty block spaces there are. Enemy layout is identical to that of the ROM, except the header in that only contains 7 bytes (3 words for defining the enemy art to be loaded, and 1 byte to define how many enemies there are.) Background layout too is stored exactly as it is in the ROM.

Platform and lava layout information should be ignored for now since I haven't figured out how I want to store the format yet.

The problem you may run into is that block layout must be condensed, but in the format KC uses. Trying to go around it and use data that is bloated will result in a memory overflow on some levels. You'd have to write some code to condense the block layout.

-----------------------------------------------

I'll explain the block layout a little. The offset to block data is at $14. It is a word, in little endian. So in map 4A, $FC15 is actually $15FC. 
The layout itself can begin with either a block or empty space marker. 

Blank space bytes - These need to fill every gap between blocks
  1 byte of $7F or less denotes blank space of that many places: 00 == 1 space, 01 == 2 spaces, 7F == 128 spaces. The entire map must be covered with blocks and / or blank spaces to fill the area.
  We need to know the map size. For map 4A, it is: $0A 02
  This is 10 x 2 screens. Using the data from above, that gets multiplied by 20 and 14 respectively. So our actual map size in blocks is 200 x 28 -- ((10 x 20) x (2 x 14))
  This gives us 5,600 blocks (200 x 28). So in order to fil the whole map with blank space, the data would be: 43 bytes of $7F + $5F. That adds up to 5,600! (43 lots of 128 + 96). Remember that byte $00 actually represents 1 block space, and $01 is 2 spaces, ect. As you add blocks, this 'blank space' block data gets smaller


Block data. If a block is listed, it will be followed by 4 bytes for data. 

$8x = visible
$Ax = hidden

$80: Rock block.    (00 00 00 00)
$81: Prize block.    aa 00 00 00; aa: contents.
$82: Ice block. 
$83: ghost block.    aa bb cc dd; aa = delay, bb cc = time shown, dd = time hidden 
$84: telepad.        aa bb cc dd; aa = map, bb = y coord (in blocks? 16 pixels), cc dd = x coord in pixels
$85: iron block. 
$86: rubber block. 
$87: shifting block. 
$89: mushroom block. 
$8A: vanishing block. aa; (bits) 0001 = shoot up, 0010 = right, 0100 = down, 1000 = left. Can combine
$8B: lift
$8C: drill block      aa; (bits) 0001 = shoot up, 0010 = right, 0100 = down, 1000 = left. Can combine
$90: collision block  aa; 1 = solid, 2 = up slope, 3 = down slope.

Prize block data.
0: Diamond
1: 10,000 points
2: Skycutter
3: Cyclone
4: Red Stealth
5: Eyeclops
6: Juggernaught
7: Iron Knight
8: Berzerker
9: Maniaxe
A: Micromax
B: 1up
C: Time
D: Continue
E: 10 Diamonds

Enemy data
Location: Read 2 bytes at $18, little endian (low byte, high byte)
Map 4A: EF18; Actual offset = $18EF
The first 6 bytes are for the 3 enemy types and palettes
The 7th byte is the total number of enemies in the map (4 in map 4A)
  Enemy date
    Enemy type
    Respawn
    Level (2 bytes)
    X location in pixels (2 bytes)
    Y location in pixels (2 bytes)
